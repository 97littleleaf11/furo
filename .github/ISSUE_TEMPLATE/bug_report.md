<!--

The starting point for issues should usually be a discussion.

https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/discussions

Possible bugs may be raised as a "Potential Issue" discussion.
Feature requests may be raised as an "Ideas" discussion.

We can determine in the discussions, if something needs to be escalated
into an "Issue" or not. This helps ensure that the "Issues" list
properly reflects ongoing or needed work on the project.
