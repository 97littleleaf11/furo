Huge shoutout to everyone who's worked on `sphinx-rtd-theme`, since it was
an absolutely essential reference for how to do things well.

The folks at ReadTheDocs are doing really important work. [TODO: say something about how ethical ads as awesome, and call-to-action pointing to RTD's sustainability page]
