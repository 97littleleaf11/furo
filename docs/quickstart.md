# Quickstart

Furo is available on [PyPI]. It provides a single customizable HTML theme for Sphinx-based documentation sets.

* Install furo in documentation's build environment.

    ```
    pip install furo
    ```

* Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

    ```py
    html_theme = "furo"
    ```

* Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! ðŸŽ‰


```{note}
If you don't have a Sphinx documentation set to use this theme on, look at [Sphinx's Getting Started] for instructions on how to create one.
